## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Tech stack: React 18+, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Workbox
   ‚Üí Structure: Frontend PWA + Supabase backend services
2. Load design documents: ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí data-model.md: Users, Lists, Items, Shares, ItemHistory entities
   ‚Üí contracts/: auth-api.yaml, lists-api.yaml
   ‚Üí research.md: PWA, offline sync, auth decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: PWA dependencies, Supabase configuration
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests for auth and lists APIs
   ‚Üí Core: models, services, components
   ‚Üí Integration: offline sync, real-time, sharing
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, PWA features
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Task completeness validated ‚úÖ
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path (Cannot be parallelized)
1. **Setup** (T001-T005) ‚Üí **Tests** (T006-T030) ‚Üí **Core Implementation** (T031-T060)
2. **T031-T035** (Models) ‚Üí **T036-T042** (Services) ‚Üí **T043-T048** (Hooks) ‚Üí **T049-T057** (Components)
3. **T061-T064** (Offline) requires **T039-T041** (Services)
4. **T065-T067** (Realtime) requires **T043-T045** (Query hooks)
5. **T068-T070** (List types) requires **T055-T056** (Pages)
6. **T071-T073** (Sharing) requires **T041** (ShareService)

### Parallel Blocks
- **Contract Tests**: T006-T023 can run simultaneously
- **Integration Tests**: T024-T030 can run simultaneously
- **Models**: T031-T035 can run simultaneously
- **Services**: T036-T042 can run simultaneously (after models)
- **Hooks**: T043-T048 can run simultaneously (after services)
- **UI Components**: T049-T054 and T058-T060 can run simultaneously (after hooks)
- **Unit Tests**: T078-T090 can run simultaneously (after implementation)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: All Contract Tests
```bash
# Launch T006-T023 together (different test files):
Task: "Contract test POST /auth/magic-link in tests/contract/auth/test_magic_link_post.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /lists in tests/contract/lists/test_lists_get.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /lists/{listId}/items in tests/contract/items/test_items_post.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /lists/{listId}/share in tests/contract/shares/test_share_post.ts"
# ... (all contract tests)
```

### Phase 3.3: Model Definitions
```bash
# Launch T031-T035 together (different type files):
Task: "User model interfaces in src/types/user.ts"
Task: "List model interfaces in src/types/list.ts"
Task: "Item model interfaces in src/types/item.ts"
Task: "Share model interfaces in src/types/share.ts"
Task: "Database schema types in src/types/database.ts"
```

### Phase 3.5: Unit Testing
```bash
# Launch T078-T083 together (different test files):
Task: "Unit tests for auth service in tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for list service in tests/unit/services/list.service.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for offline sync in tests/unit/services/offline.service.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for React hooks in tests/unit/hooks/"
```

## Current Status Assessment

Based on the current project state analysis:

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Project structure and dependencies configured
- Environment setup with Supabase integration
- Basic Vite + React + TypeScript foundation
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Package.json with development scripts

### üîÑ In Progress
- Database schema implementation (partial)
- Basic UI components (some exist in src/)
- Authentication setup (configured but not fully implemented)

### ‚ùå Not Started
- Contract tests (critical TDD requirement)
- Integration tests for user flows
- Offline synchronization with IndexedDB
- Real-time collaboration features
- PWA-specific components and service worker
- Sharing system implementation
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Next Immediate Actions
1. **T006-T030**: Write all contract and integration tests (MUST FAIL initially)
2. **T031-T035**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all entities
3. **T036-T042**: Implement core services with proper error handling
4. **T043-T048**: Create React Query hooks for data fetching
5. **T049-T060**: Build React components following shadcn/ui patterns

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T006-T023)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T031-T035)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T030 ‚Üí T031+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD order enforced: Tests ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Components
- [x] Dependencies clearly mapped for execution order

## Notes
- **[P]** tasks target different files with no shared dependencies
- All tests must be written and failing before ANY implementation begins
- Commit after completing each task for incremental progress tracking
- PWA features (T058-T060, T091-T093) are critical for mobile-first requirement
- Real-time features (T065-T067) enable collaborative list editing
- Offline support (T061-T064) ensures app works without internet connectivity
