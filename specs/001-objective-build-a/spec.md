# Feature Specification: Mobile-First PWA List Management Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-objective-build-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Objective: Build a mobile-first web application with PWA capabilities for managing lists (simple, grocery, countdown) using spec-driven development via Spec Kit. Focus on React, Vercel, and Supabase. Prioritize simplicity, mobile-friendly UI, private-by-default sharing, and a foundation for future smart list features (typeahead, sorting memory, meal-to-grocery linking)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to create and manage different types of lists on their mobile device, being able to access them offline and share them privately with others. They need three distinct list types: simple task lists for general organization, grocery lists for shopping with check-off capability, and countdown lists for tracking important events with time displays.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the application for the first time, **When** they sign up and access the dashboard, **Then** they see an empty dashboard with options to create their first list
2. **Given** a user creates a simple list, **When** they add items and mark some as complete, **Then** the items show completion status and remain accessible offline
3. **Given** a user creates a grocery list, **When** they add items and check them off while shopping, **Then** checked items visually indicate completion and sync when back online
4. **Given** a user creates a countdown list with a future date/time, **When** they view the list, **Then** they see a live countdown timer displaying time remaining
5. **Given** a user wants to share a list, **When** they generate a sharing link, **Then** invited users can access the list with specified permissions (read or edit)
6. **Given** a user is offline, **When** they edit any list, **Then** changes are saved locally and sync automatically when connectivity returns
7. **Given** a user installs the PWA, **When** they access it from their home screen, **Then** it launches like a native app with full functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to share a list but has no internet connection?
- How does the system handle countdown lists with past dates?
- What occurs when multiple users edit the same shared list simultaneously?
- How does the system behave when local storage is full?
- What happens when a user receives a notification for a countdown while the app is closed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core List Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create three distinct list types: simple, grocery, and countdown
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, delete, and reorder items within any list
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to mark items as complete in simple and grocery lists
- **FR-004**: System MUST display live countdown timers for countdown list items with target dates
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all list data and maintain it across app sessions

#### User Management & Authentication
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide user authentication via magic links sent to email addresses
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain user accounts with unique identifiers
- **FR-008**: System MUST associate lists with their creating user by default
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data

#### Sharing & Privacy
- **FR-010**: System MUST create all lists as private by default
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow only list owners to generate sharing links for their lists

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents an authenticated person using the application, contains identification information and authentication details, owns lists and has sharing permissions
- **List**: Represents a collection of items with a specific type (simple, grocery, countdown), belongs to a user, has privacy settings and sharing permissions
- **Item**: Represents individual entries within a list, contains content/description, completion status, optional target dates for countdowns, and sort ordering
- **Share**: Represents sharing permissions between users and lists, defines access levels (read/edit), tracks invited users, and includes 24-hour expiration timestamps
- **ItemHistory**: Represents past items within each list to enable future predictive features, tracks item frequency and user patterns, deleted when list is permanently removed
- **Session**: Represents user authentication state and offline synchronization status
- **Notification**: Represents countdown alerts and system notifications, linked to countdown items with timing preferences
