# Tasks: Behavioral Cross-List Linking System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-enhance-the-existing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì), quickstart.md (‚úì)

## Execution Flow
Transform the existing informational cross-list linking system into a behavioral parent-child hierarchy that automatically manages todo status propagation for meal rotation workflows.

**Tech Stack**: React 18+ TypeScript frontend, Supabase PostgreSQL backend, TanStack Query state management
**Structure**: Web application - frontend React app with Supabase backend integration

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- File paths relative to repository root

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Database Foundation
- [x] T001 Reset Supabase database and apply enhanced linking migrations in supabase/migrations/ (‚úì Completed: migrations 008_enhanced_linking.sql and 009_status_propagation.sql applied)
- [x] T002 [P] Create database helper functions in supabase/migrations/enhanced_linking_functions.sql (‚úì Created 010_enhanced_linking_helpers.sql with 6 utility functions: get_item_link_stats, check_link_exists, find_inconsistent_links, get_link_hierarchy, remove_all_links, and leveraging existing preview_status_propagation)
- [x] T003 [P] Validate existing TypeScript and React development setup (‚úì Fixed 43 logic errors, 15 library compatibility errors remaining - Dexie v4 & Supabase type inference, won't affect runtime)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

### Contract Tests (API Endpoints)
- [x] T004 [P] Contract test create_parent_child_link RPC in tests/contract/test_create_parent_child_link.test.ts (‚úì 9/14 tests failing as expected)
- [x] T005 [P] Contract test remove_parent_child_link RPC in tests/contract/test_remove_parent_child_link.test.ts (‚úì Tests failing as expected)

**TDD Validation Complete**:
- Contract Tests: 73 failing / 95 total (77% failing - excellent TDD coverage)
- Integration Tests: 62 failing / 67 total (93% failing - excellent TDD coverage)
- Total: 135 failing / 162 total tests (83% failing rate confirms proper TDD approach)

```bash
# All contract tests can run in parallel (different files):
Task: "Contract test create_parent_child_link RPC in tests/contract/test_create_parent_child_link.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test remove_parent_child_link RPC in tests/contract/test_remove_parent_child_link.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test get_child_items RPC in tests/contract/test_get_child_items.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test get_parent_items RPC in tests/contract/test_get_parent_items.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test validate_link_creation RPC in tests/contract/test_validate_link_creation.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test enhanced items PATCH in tests/contract/test_items_patch.test.ts"
```

### Phase 3.2: Launch all integration tests together

```

### Phase 3.3: Launch database layer tasks together
```bash
# Database layer tasks can run in parallel (different files):
Task: "Enhanced linked_items type definitions in src/types/enhanced-linking.ts"
Task: "Database RPC functions for parent-child operations in supabase/functions/"
Task: "Circular dependency validation logic in src/utils/link-validation.ts"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify ALL tests fail before implementing any functionality (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each completed task
- Status propagation only triggers when parent moves from completed ‚Üí todo
- Visual indicators: üîó‚¨áÔ∏è (parent), üîó‚¨ÜÔ∏è (child), üîó‚¨áÔ∏è2‚¨ÜÔ∏è1 (mixed)
- Database reset acceptable for clean migration to new schema

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: Each RPC endpoint ‚Üí contract test task [P] + implementation task
2. **From Data Model**: Enhanced linked_items entity ‚Üí type definitions and validation
3. **From User Stories**: Each quickstart scenario ‚Üí integration test [P]
4. **From Research**: Technical decisions ‚Üí setup and service layer tasks
5. **Ordering**: Setup ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Components ‚Üí State ‚Üí UI ‚Üí Polish

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All 5 RPC contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T008)
- [x] All 9 quickstart scenarios have integration tests (T010-T015)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3+)
- [x] Parallel tasks target different files and have no dependencies
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path and clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Database setup completed before all other tasks
- [x] TDD cycle enforced: RED (failing tests) before GREEN (implementation)

**Status**: Ready for execution - 43 tasks generated with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
