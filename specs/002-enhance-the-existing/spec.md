# Feature Specification: Behavioral Cross-List Linking System

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhance-the-existing`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhance the existing cross-list linking system with parent-child hierarchical relationships and behavioral automation.

Current linking is informational only - items show relationships but no automatic actions occur when completion states change.

Requirements:
- Parent items can control multiple child items (1-to-many relationships)
- When parent item moves from completed to todo status, all child items should automatically move to todo (unless already todo)
- Individual item completion remains independent - checking off any item doesn't affect linked items
- Link creation flow: select parent item, then select multiple target items to become children
- Visual distinction: parent items show  indicator with child count, child items show  indicator with parent count
- Prevent circular dependencies and self-linking
- Children can have multiple parents
- Remove bulk linking operations to avoid confusion

Primary use case: Meal rotation workflow where meal items (parents) control ingredient items (children), enabling easy meal planning cycles."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user manages meal planning by creating meal items (e.g., "Steak Dinner") and linking them to ingredient items (e.g., "Steak", "Potatoes", "Carrots") across different lists. When the user wants to repeat a meal after some time, they move the meal back to their todo list, and the system automatically ensures all required ingredients are also moved to todo status for the next shopping trip, enabling efficient meal rotation cycles.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a meal item "Steak Dinner" marked as completed and linked to ingredient items "Steak", "Potatoes", "Carrots" (some completed, some not), **When** the user moves "Steak Dinner" back to todo status, **Then** all linked ingredient items that were completed should automatically move to todo status while those already in todo remain unchanged
2. **Given** a user selects a meal item "Chicken Pasta" for linking, **When** they select multiple ingredient items "Chicken", "Pasta", "Sauce" to link to it, **Then** the meal becomes a parent item with visual indicator showing 3 children, and each ingredient becomes a child with visual indicator showing 1 parent
3. **Given** a user has ingredient "Tomatoes" linked to both "Pizza" and "Pasta" meal items, **When** they move "Pizza" to todo status, **Then** "Tomatoes" moves to todo, and when they later move "Pasta" to todo, **Then** "Tomatoes" remains in todo without duplication or conflict
4. **Given** a user tries to create a circular link where item A is parent of item B and then tries to make item B parent of item A, **When** they attempt this link creation, **Then** the system prevents the link and shows an error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to link an item to itself?
- How does system handle deletion of parent items that have children?
- What occurs when a child item is deleted while still linked to parents?
- How does the system behave when attempting to create complex chain relationships (A’B’C)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support hierarchical parent-child relationships between list items across different lists
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow one parent item to control multiple child items (1-to-many relationship)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow child items to have multiple parent items (many-to-1 relationship)
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically move child items from completed to todo status when their parent item moves to todo status
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT automatically change child status when parent item moves from todo to completed
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve independent completion behavior - any item can be marked complete/incomplete without affecting linked items
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual distinction showing parent items with downward arrow and child count
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual distinction showing child items with upward arrow and parent count
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent circular dependency creation (if A is parent of B, B cannot be parent of A)
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent self-linking (item cannot be parent of itself)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide link creation flow where user selects parent item first, then selects multiple target items to become children
- **FR-012**: System MUST remove or disable bulk linking operations to prevent confusion about parent-child directionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle child items that already have todo status gracefully (no state change needed)
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain link integrity when items are deleted by removing broken references

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Parent-Child Link**: Directional relationship from one parent item to multiple child items, enabling behavioral automation when parent status changes
- **Parent Item**: List item that can control the todo status of its linked child items, displays visual indicator with child count
- **Child Item**: List item that responds to parent status changes, can have multiple parents, displays visual indicator with parent count
- **Link Creation Session**: User interaction flow where a parent item is selected first, followed by selection of multiple target items to establish parent-child relationships
